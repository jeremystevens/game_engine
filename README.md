## 🚀 Installation

**No installation required!** This engine uses only Python's standard library.

Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- tkinter (included with most Python installations)

## 🎮 Quick Start

```python
from engine import GameEngine, GameObject, Vector2, Sprite, SoundGenerator

class MyGame(GameEngine):
    def initialize(self):
        # Initialize sound system
        self.sound_generator = SoundGenerator()
        self.sound_generator.initialize_default_sounds()
        
        # Create a game object
        player = GameObject("Player")
        player.transform.position = Vector2(400, 300)
        
        # Add a sprite component
        sprite = Sprite(color='#0096FF', size=Vector2(50, 50))
        player.add_component(sprite)
        
        # Add to scene
        self.current_scene.add_object(player)
    
    def update(self, delta_time):
        # Game logic here
        if self.input_manager.is_key_pressed('space'):
            self.sound_generator.play_sound("bullet")
            print("Space pressed!")

# Run the game
game = MyGame("My 2D Game", (800, 600))
game.run()
```

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

### Component System
The engine uses a component-based architecture where game objects are containers for components that define behavior:

```python
# Create a game object
player = GameObject("Player")

# Add components
player.add_component(Sprite(color='#FF0000'))
player.add_component(CustomBehavior())

# Components can access the game object
class CustomBehavior(Component):
    def update(self, delta_time):
        # Move the game object
        self.game_object.transform.translate(Vector2(100 * delta_time, 0))
```

### Transform Hierarchy
Supports parent-child relationships with automatic world space calculations:

```python
parent = GameObject("Parent")
child = GameObject("Child")

# Set up hierarchy
child.transform.parent = parent.transform

# Child position is relative to parent
child.transform.position = Vector2(50, 0)  # 50 units to the right of parent

# Optional 3D support
child.transform.enable_3d()
child.transform.quaternion_rotation = Quaternion.from_axis_angle(Vector3.up(), math.pi/4)
```

### Pure Python Rendering
Custom 2D renderer built on tkinter Canvas:

```python
# The renderer can draw various shapes
renderer.draw_rectangle(position, size, color='#FF0000', rotation=math.pi/4)
renderer.draw_circle(position, radius, color='#00FF00')
renderer.draw_polygon(points, color='#0000FF')
```

## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Custom Components
Extend the Component class to create custom behaviors:

```python
class HealthComponent(Component):
    def __init__(self, max_health=100):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_health = max_health
        self.current_health = max_health
    
    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.current_health = max(0, self.current_health - damage)
        if self.current_health == 0:
            self.game_object.destroy()
```

### Input Handling
Comprehensive input system with multiple access patterns:

```python
# In your game update loop
if input_manager.is_key_just_pressed('space'):
    player.jump()

# Get normalized movement vector
movement = input_manager.get_movement_vector()
player.transform.translate(movement * speed * delta_time)
```

### Vector Mathematics
Rich 2D and 3D vector systems with all standard operations:

```python
# 2D Vector operations
velocity = Vector2(100, 50)
acceleration = Vector2(0, -9.8)
velocity += acceleration * delta_time

# 3D Vector operations
position_3d = Vector3(10, 20, 30)
direction_3d = Vector3.forward()
cross_product = position_3d.cross(direction_3d)

# Advanced operations
distance = player_pos.distance_to(enemy_pos)
direction = (target_pos - current_pos).normalize()
rotated = velocity.rotate(math.pi / 4)
```

### Procedural Audio System
Generate sound effects using mathematical waveforms:

```python
from engine import SoundGenerator

# Initialize sound system
sound_gen = SoundGenerator()

# Create custom sounds
bullet_sound = sound_gen.create_bullet_sound()
explosion_sound = sound_gen.create_explosion_sound()
engine_sound = sound_gen.create_engine_sound()

# Register and play sounds
sound_gen.register_sound(bullet_sound)
sound_gen.play_sound("bullet")

# Or use built-in sounds
sound_gen.initialize_default_sounds()
sound_gen.play_sound("explosion")
```

### Scene Management
Organize your game into scenes for different states:

```python
menu_scene = Scene("Menu")
game_scene = Scene("Game")

# Switch between scenes
engine.load_scene(game_scene)
```

## 🎯 Why Pure Python?

This project demonstrates several important concepts:

1. **Understanding Fundamentals**: Building from scratch teaches you how game engines actually work
2. **No Dependencies**: Eliminates external library conflicts and licensing concerns
3. **Educational Value**: Perfect for learning game development concepts
4. **Portability**: Runs anywhere Python runs, no additional installations
5. **Customization**: Complete control over every aspect of the engine

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

While this engine prioritizes education and simplicity over raw performance, it includes several optimizations:

- **Efficient Vector Operations**: Optimized mathematical operations
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse game objects to reduce garbage collection
